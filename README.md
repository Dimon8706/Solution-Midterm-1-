Smart Home Control System - Overview

This system simulates the management of smart devices in a home using five design patterns: Composite, Decorator, Abstract Factory, Facade, and Adapter. The goal is to make it easy to control devices like lights, thermostats, and other smart appliances.

Key Components

1. Composite Pattern:
   Purpose: Group devices into rooms. A room can contain many devices (like lights and thermostats).
   Example: The Room class holds multiple devices and controls them together.

2. Decorator Pattern:
   Purpose: Add extra features to devices without changing their original code.
   Example: The ScheduledOperationDecorator adds scheduling (turning devices on or off at specific times) to devices like lights.

3. Abstract Factory Pattern:
   Purpose: Create different types of devices (basic or advanced) without specifying their exact classes.
   Example: The BasicSmartHomeFactory creates basic devices like lights and thermostats.

4. Facade Pattern:
   Purpose: Simplify the interface for controlling devices.
   Example: The SmartHomeController provides simple methods to control all devices, like turning everything on or off.

5. Adapter Pattern:
   Purpose: Integrate external systems (e.g., weather API) into the home system.
   Example: The WeatherAPIAdapter adapts the external weather system to work as a device in the home.

Key Features

- Device Management: Add and control devices easily.
- Scheduling: Devices can be scheduled to turn on/off at specific times.
        - Extendability: Add new devices or features easily.
        - External System Integration: Connect to external systems (like weather APIs).
        - Simplified Control: Use a central controller for managing devices.

How It Works

1. Create Devices: Use factories to create devices.
2. Control Devices: Use the SmartHomeController to turn devices on/off.
3. Add Features: Use decorators to add extra functions like scheduling.
4. Integrate External Systems: Use adapters to connect to things like weather services.


Conclusion

  This system makes it easy to manage and control smart devices in your home, with the ability to add new devices or integrate external systems easily. The use of design patterns ensures flexibility and scalability.
